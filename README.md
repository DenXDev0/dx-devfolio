# 🧑‍💻 My Personal Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing my works in a clean and interactive manner.
This project serves as the main showcase to introduce who I am and what I build.

Built with **Next.js** for SSR/SSG and performance, and styled using **Sass (SCSS)** for a modular, maintainable codebase.
Special thanks to [`bchiang7/v4`](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) for the design inspiration.
